            <p>If you're interested in creating your own digital time capsule, then below is a short list of resources that I found most helpful while putting together this digital time capsule. Due to the short turnaround for this assignment, this digital time capsule is more like a digital scrapbook due to the lack of other media such as embedded videos, recordings, screenshots, and links to other articles that better reflect the Nov.-Dec. 2023 time period. I also wanted to include some things that reflect personal challenges and struggles as well, but didn't have enough time. Oh well, there's always later. I still call this website a digital time capsule just because it sounds cooler than calling it a digital scrapbook. Maybe once I gain more web design skills, I could incorporate more interactive elements to my digital time capsule and future webpages.

	            </ul>
              This article gives a thorough overview of the concept of a digital time capsule, why it is meaningful for preservation purposes, a recommended 10-steps guide in creating a digital time capsule, and mostly importantly, how to secure it from data loss, hacking, servers going down, etc. It also lists potential ideas of what to include in a digital time capsule, mentioning that time capsules can be used to celebrate a friendship or to commemorate a class' school experiences. A standout advice was try to keep the digital time capsule authentic by going beyond highlights and positive moments to  also include personal challenges, struggles, and lessons learned during the life journey.

	            </ul>
              This Experience Dropbox article is interesting because  it goes over the history of time capsules and describing some famous ones such as the Crypt of Civilization from the late 1930's (opening date: 8113!) and the slightly more recent Voyager Golden Records from 1977. Dropbox's cloud storage and secured file sharing features enables users to create personalized digital time capsules, perfect for the age of the Internet. It also gives ideas of what types of digital time capsules to make, such as New Year's resolution digital time capsule, study time capsule, and social media time capsule.

                    <p>The Internet Archive is a well-known digital time capsule, especially since it has the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> feature that allows users to search and explore its archive of more than 916 billion web pages and counting saved over time. It was founded in 1996, serving as an online repository of human history, while also being described as "a non-profit  library of millions of free texts, movies, software, music, websites, and more".</p>
