          <div class="small-container">
            <p>This section contains letters to my future self one year, five years, and ten years into the future. I have no clue what the far future will bring, and I'm not sure I'm able to write long letters to myself without making it really awkward, hence why I'm calling them brief notes, less intimidating that way. Please bear with me on these notes to myself. They are more like a stream of consciousness while working late into the night since I'm a night owl.

            <p>This time of year is definitely stressful as you push  yourself to complete the e-Portfolio and final assignments/projects to earn your MLIS from Dominican University and with the holidays on top of everything else going on. If your coursework is on-schedule, I mean. If not, that's okay! You don't want to burn yourself out when you're so close to that degree. Be kind to yourself, manage your time to do well and not half-heartedly, because I know your perfectionism won't allow for sloppy work. Prioritize school first, because it won't be forever even though it feels like it right now. The holidays will always come around again, as they always do. They're not going away. You can do this! - <strong>Love, Helen from Dec. 2024</strong>

            <h2>Dear Helen 5 Years From Now,</h2>
	        <p>I have so many questions for you. How are you doing? Are you in good health? Are you a full-fledged librarian at this point? Are Mom and Dad still okay? Is David working full-time by now? If life is not so good right now with your current stuggles, just know that you're doing your best with what you have right now. I know you're resourceful, you've always been that way. It's okay to reach out and rely on others, even though it's scary, but you're not alone in this. I hope you were able or about to go on another big travel adventure within these last five years, but I'll understand if you haven't, with life's increasing obligations as we all get older. Knowing you, if you're still worrying about the future, then save even more money and don't spend it on so much unnecessary clutter. The things that are most valuable are what you can't see or hold in your hands literally. - <strong>Love, Helen from Dec. 2024</strong>

        <h2>Dear Helen 10 Years From Now, </h2>
            <p>Congratulations on hitting a major milestone in your life journey! I know you're embarrassed about how much older you're getting, but time doesn't stand still for anyone, unless they're immortal elves. I'm definitely surprised that you still remember how to access this repository and go back to this digital time capsule, even though it's more of a holiday time capsule. Hope David is doing okay. Help each other out, okay? Even if he gets on your nerves sometimes, but that's just the way his personality runs, can't change it at this late juncture. Keeping chugging away since you're getting closer to retirement. Hope you're still living a full life in the way that you want, since happiness and contentment are fleeting. - <strong>Love, Helen from Dec. 2024</strong>
