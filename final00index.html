                <li><i>Leaves brightly flaming,</i></li>
                <li><i>One final blaze of glory,</i></li>

              <p><strong>November and December are the coziest months</strong> for me personally, with being able to witness the seasonal transition from fall to winter, before the weather gets even colder into the next year. It signifies the approaching end of the year, before beginning again in the endless cycle of life. This sense of quiet nostalgia with a nuance of melancholy lends itself well to the theme of my digital capsule. This personalized digital time capsule attempts to capture these fleeting memories and moments of joy, both big and little, before I forget them completely. As a winter birthday person who is sentimental at heart, the period of time between late November and early December holds a lot of meaning, so I'll be diving into the past, present, and future.</p>
              <p>This home page briefly goes over the highlights of the months of November and December 2024 for me. The <i>"Past"</i> is a photo essay detailing my late autumn/early winter trip to Japan last year in 2023, the <i>"Present"</i> is a 2024 digital holiday letter to family and friends, and the <i>"Future"</i> is brief notes to my future self 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years from the current year of 2024. I also linked to external sources such as <i>FutureMe</i> and the <i>Internet Archive</i> since they were interesting and informative when it comes to cataloging the digital present for the future. Learn more about them in the <i>More Resources</i> section.</p>
              <p>This is merely a glimpse into November-December 2024 from my perspective. The opening haiku poem (5-7-5 syllable pattern) was written by me. To those who discovers this digital time capsule online, may you find it insightful, uplifting, and somewhat entertaining because I really had fun creating it!</p>

              <p>This November was unusual weather-wise for southern California since there was a noticeable delay in the leaves changing color. By late November all the leaves would have already fallen off by now. But the pomegranate tree leaves were still clinging on, with some still a solid green. I assisted my mom with harvesting a medium-sized box full of splitting ripe pomegranates from the tree in the backyard by using a very long fruit picker tool, bright early on that peaceful morning. Heard just birds chirping away and even spotted a squirrel running on a thick cable wire hanging right above the backyard, which I nicknamed the <strong>"squirrel freeway"</strong>. It was a shame that I couldn't take a photo of it since it was too fast in scurrying away from the backyard; it would have been a nice addition to this digital time capsule. It was nice spending some mother-daughter time together, especially since I'm not a morning person.</p>
              <p>The month flew by quickly as it got closer to Thanksgiving. It was still a busy month, doing weekly storytimes, running a monthly craft library program, and keeping up with my committee work while working at the Laguna Hills Technlogy Branch Library, on top of doing 2 online classes at Dominican University in Illinois. I've <strong>worked full-time for two years so far at this current library</strong>, but I might get transferred to another branch next year due to 3 libraries in the system closing in Summer 2025 because the city of Irvine is pulling out of the OC Public Libraries system. My family also bought a very fresh Christmas Noble Fir tree from Home Depot one week earlier this year when the usual family tradition was to buy it on Black Friday, but not this year! I was so thankful for the brief breather that came with Thanksgiving, with OC Public Libraries closed for 2 consecutive days for the holiday observance.</p>
              <h2>December 2024 Highlights</h2>

              <p><strong>December is my birthday month</strong>, so I can't fully relax to celebrate until after all my final projects are completed for the Fall 2024 semester, and the Christmas tree inside the house is still not decorated yet. I'm in-charge of holiday decorating for the family. Last year, I decorated for the holidays super early before my Japan 2023 trip since I wasn't in the MLIS graduate program back then, but it looks like this year I will be decorating super late this year, so it balances out.</p>
              <p>My parents got me the <strong>Keurig K-Café Barista Bar Single Serve Coffee Maker and Frother</strong> from Costco as my birthday present since it was something that I've been wanting. The impetus for this gift is because they want me to cut back or to stop buying fancy drinks since the costs do add up. I've been having cafe lattes so far since it also came with some K-cups. My brother David enjoys using it even more than me. Having a steaming cup of latte in the cold early morning right now is the best!</p>
              <p>I just completed my first online group project in Dominican University's MLIS graduate project for <strong>LIS 882 - Metadata for Digital Resources</strong>. It's much more difficult to coordinate meetings across 2 difference time zones and 3 different life schedules. There were some mishaps at the beginning and at the end, such as a 4th group member going MIA, and technical submission issues on Canva. It took longer than expected to finish, but all the deliverables were turned in six hours before the deadline. My group and I powered through and it's finally done!</p>
              <p>This month is far from over since it is only <strong>December 8, 2024</strong>, as I am typing this for the LIS 753 Internet Fundamentals and Design final website project. Overall, my life isn't very interesting, but I try to enjoy each day as it comes because who knows what could happen.
