          <h1 id="article-title">Dear Family and Friends,</h1>
          <div class="small-container">
            <p><strong>Holiday Greetings!</strong> How are you? Hope you are staying warm and safe here in California with all the sudden weather changes. One week it is hot like summer, but then the next week the temperature drops with a difference of nearly 20 degrees fahrenheit. The Santa Ana winds came back with a vengeance recently, but at least this time none of the potted plants in the front and back yards tipped over. I'm a year older now, but I still possess the same mentality. Working at my library has been great so far, really mellow until my supervisor tells me otherwise. No drama so far since the space is so small and narrow that staff is nearly stepping on each other's toes. Getting along with each other is a must. Mostly I've been working, going to school, and running errands, so nothing special really. Looking forward to this upcoming winter break (Dec. 23, 2024 - Jan. 1, 2025) where I get time off from both work and school to relax, go somewhere fun and nearby, and catch up with the long neglected deep cleaning and actually do some leisurely reading that's not school-related. <strong>I've been leading a full life despite not doing much. Time flies too quickly regardless of how much or how little I do.</strong> 
            </p>
            <h2>Updates on My Life</h2>

            <p><strong>Almost Peaceful Home Life</strong> - My family is doing well so far, and so is my brother.  Dad is keeping himself busy somehow after being retirely for a little over a year by now. Although sometimes Dad and Mom get onto each other's nerves due to sharing the same space 24/7 daily, since both people are fully retired now. Mom wishes she was still working in some capacity since she admits things were easier when she was. We've also been eating more at home nowadays to reduce costs, so recently had homestyle spicy seafood hotpot last weekend. Had Thanksgiving lunch with Mom's side of the family, bringing mango cake for dessert. I still think Costco's pumpkin pie is the best fall dessert though.  
            </p>
            <p><strong>Tsundoku</strong> (積ん読) : buying books but letting them pile up and not reading them. If one word perfectly encapsulates my life, it would be this. Because I'm always tempted to get books, but then I let them sit there until I'm either in the mood or I find it again by happenstance. Another reason why I just want to devote a few days to just reading the books I have right now, both library and personal books.</p>
            <p><strong>Work Stuff</strong> : I attended the <strong>2024 ALA Annual Conference</strong> in San Diego in July, which was my first time going, good experience overall. Bought home way too much stuff - 5-6 tote bags of ARCs and industry swag. I was also made the <strong>Discover & Go Committee Co-Chair</strong> in July as well, meaning more responsibilities and workload, but I'll manage somehow. Have to prepare to conduct a systemwide online training on the Discover & Go program for all OC Public Libraries staff. Need to get started on this ASAP! Also trying to be more sociable with the Community Center staff since the library is located inside the City of Laguna Hills Community Center after all. The center is much more decked out for the holidays, both inside and outside, compared to last year.

            <p><strong>Who knows what next year will bring?</strong> The Lunar New Year, my second favorite holiday after Christmas, is happening much earlier this year, on January 29, 2025, when it is usually in February, closer to the Valentine's Day holiday. 2025 is the year of the snake, and I'm not very fond of snakes, but spiders are even worser. The uncertainities of next year worries me, rather than making me excited in a positive way. There is a Chinese curse saying, <i>"May you live in interesting times"</i>, but I would rather read about these "interesting times" in a historical non-fiction book or textbook, far removed, then directly experience them myself, but there is no choice in the matter, reality is just what it is right now.   
            </p>
            <p>I have a few New Year resolutions in mind, such as developing a more positive mindset that focuses on growth, taking better care of myself health-wise (eat less junk food, snack less, get moving), and being more considerate of others since this world needs more kindness, not less.
            </p>
