              <li>Went from Nov. 30 - Dec. 10, 2023.</li>
  		        <li>Visited Tokyo, Kamakura, Hakone, Odawara, Takayama, Kanazawa, and Kyoto in a whirlwind 10-day trip.</li>
  		        <li>Got sick with the flu unexpectedly halfway through; decided to tough it out for the rest of the trip.</li>
  		        <li>Made it home safely and on schedule, with no significant delays, before the early January 2024 disasters such as the Kanazawa earthquake & Haneda Airport explosion.</li>
	      </ul>
            </p>
	      <p>This was my second time visiting Japan, with the first time back in April 2019, just in time for the cherry blossom season, by taking part in a 15-day guided tour group excursion. For this second trip, I decided to buy a self-guided tour package from Samurai Tours, who dealt with the lodging and internal transportation logistics. On hindsight, I should have realized before booking the trip that visiting that many places in such a short timeframe was too ambitious with way too much traveling and not enough lingering. It was only when I sat in the plane at LAX airport that I realized it wasn't going to be a relaxing trip at all. David, my brother, and I still managed to have some fun and to do quite a bit despite the hectic schedule, but never again! By now, I know how to arrange the lodgings and transportation by myself for a more leisurely-paced trip if there ever is a next time.</p>
        <p>The irony was that David and I skipped the annual family Thanksgiving lunch with my mom's side of the family because we didn't want to get sick right before the trip, since the trip was purposedly scheduled to start a few days after Thanksgiving, to bypass one of the busiest times of the year at LAX. But I got sick nearly five days into the trip, due to a guy sitting nearby turning around to sneeze in my face while I was eating at the hotel breakfast buffet. Then my brother got sick towards the end of the trip and he thought it originated from me, but later at home, it turns out that I had the flu while he had COVID! Thankfully we had updated vaccinations before the trip so I was very lucky not to catch COVID as well while rooming together to save on trip expenses and to have a lot of sick leave saved up to take additional time off from work. This trip had a happy ending: both David and I recovered by Christmas time to have Christmas lunch with our relatives. As a homebody who likes occasional adventures, my travel experiences so far has always made me grateful to have a home to come back to. <strong>Lesson learned: never eat in crowded places during the cold and flu season while traveling far from home!</strong></p>

              <ul style="line-height:180%">
                <li>Collecting <strong>shrine and temple stamps</strong> in my stamp book while visting various shrines and/or temples at each town/city.</li>
                <li>Seeing the <strong>beautiful fall foilage</strong>, such as red and orange maples & golden yellow ginkgos.</li>
                <li>Eating at the <strong>Dining Cafe Iserlohn Fortress</strong> (online reservation only) based on the Legend of the Galactic Heroes military space opera anime after figuring out the tricky online reservation that was entirely in Japanese, and requiring the name to be typed in hiragana despite foreign names using katagana spelling, and a Japanese phone number (used my Tokyo hotel number).</li>
                <li>Seeing how the Japanese people <strong>decorate for the holidays</strong> in-person and up close, loving how the Christmas lights nearly covers up to the tree branches' tips.</li>
  		          <li>Experiencing how the traditional and modern aspects of Japanese culture blend together, often sharing the same space, such as a shrine tucked into the nook of a modern skyscraper. Loved the Japanese sense of aesthetics and <strong>finding beauty in unexpected places</strong>.</li>
                <li>Praying in front of the <strong>giant outdoor Buddha statue</strong> in Kamakura, and getting to go inside it.</li>
                <li>Visitng <strong>Enoshima Aquarium</strong> and seeing their extensive jellyfish exhibits.</li>
                <li>Deviating from the set schedule by forgoing the Hakone Loop and exploring the small city of <strong>Odawara</strong> instead by touring its castle and surroundings.</li>
                <li>Learning how to <strong>use the Suica IC card to buy hot and cold drinks from the vending machines</strong>: select first, and then pay, which is the opposite of how American vending machines operate.</li>
                <li>Appreciating <strong>small moments</strong> such as enjoying warm miso soup for breakfast while contemplating the sight of an outdoor, lone bright red marple tree contrasting against the foggy atmosphere in Takayama.</li>
                <li>Bathing in both public and private <strong>onsens (hot springs)</strong> 3 times, with the Takayama balcony private onsen being a personal favorite and steaming hot air alleviating my symptoms.</li>
                <li>Visiting <strong>Kanazawa castle park</strong> and seeing gardeners preparing the pine trees for the winter.</li>
                <li>Eating the best tasting green matcha soft serve ice cream cone ever after visiting <strong>Kinkakuji Temple (The Golden Pavilion)</strong> in Kyoto, really soothed my sore throat.</li>
                <li>Eating <strong>Vietnamese pho chicken soup</strong> at a Vietnamese restaurant near the Kyoto JR Station since it was almost the end of the trip and I was getting homesick.</li>

            <h2>My Reasons For Going</h2>
            <p><i><q>Hold this moment forever, I tell myself; it may never come again.</q>- Pico Iyer (Autumn Light: Season of Fire and Farewells)</i> 
            </p>
            <p>I have wanted to visit Japan again by taking one big international trip before I need to buckle down and start my first semster of Dominican University's online MLIS graduate program in January 2024, right after the New Year holiday. And while the U.S. Dollar-Japanese Yen conversion rate was still favorable towards the stronger U.S. dollar. I have already experience the cherry blossom season in Japan, and now wanted to do the fall foilage viewing since I have not visited the East Coast in the United States. To me, the autumn season ultimately symbolizes mortality, because all living things die in the end, and because of that, living moments are transitory, just like the color-changing fall leaves. I knew this instinctively, but the author Pico Iyer writes more eloquently about it in his recent memoir, <i>Autumn Light: Season of Fire and Farewells</i>. There are a lot of great quotes that I saved from it to remember:

	        <p><q>Cherry blossoms, pretty and frothy as schoolgirls' giggles, are the face the country likes to present to the world, all pink and white eroticism; but it's <strong>the reddening of the maple leaves under a blaze of ceramic-blue skies that is the place's secret heart</strong>. We cherish things, Japan has always known, precisely because they cannot last; it's their frailty that adds sweetness to their beauty</q>.
            </p>
         <p>“We're so convinced we're moving forwards when all I seem to do is go round and round with the seasons, certainly no wiser, and often only more sure of how much I cannot know.”
         </p>
        <p>“Autumn poses the question we all have to live with: How to hold on to the things we love even though we know that we and they are dying. How to see the world as it is, yet find light within that truth.”
        </p>
        <p>“What do we have to hold on to? Only the certainty that nothing will go according to design; <strong>our hopes are newly built wooden houses</strong>, sturdy until someone drops a cigarette or match.” [Sidenote: This resonated with me because Pico talks about his parents' home and belongings being lost in a California wildfire and as a Californian, it's one of my fears I keep in the back of my mind.]
        </p>
        <p><strong>“The only things that mattered were the things that were gone forever.”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to travel and make memories while I'm still healthy enough to handle the rigors of international travel, and also while my parents are still relatively healthy so I don't have to worry about them while far away from them for long periods of time. Life is too short and I want to carry the least amount of regrets possible while I'm still living.</p>
