                        A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.  I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

                        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!

                        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

                        The problem with being human is that our minds are made for a certain purpose (staying alive), but we mistake them for absolute arbiters of truth. We assume that the categories “the limits of what my mind can think” and “the truth of the universe” exactly overlap. We think in much the same way that we hear or see, i.e., within a limited range, selected to help us to survive. All that thinking has an unfortunate by-product: ego. Who is trying to survive? “I” am. The mind takes a vast unitary wholeness and selects one tiny segment of it (me, my body) and starts narrating stories from that point of view and –just like that– that entity (George!) becomes real and is (surprise, surprise) located at the exact center of the universe, and everything that is happening is happening in his movie, so to speak; it is all, somehow both “for” and “about” him. And, in this way, moral judgment arises: what is good for him is… good. And vice versa. The bear is neither good nor bad until, looking hungry, it starts walking toward George.

                        <strong>We are navigating, in every moment, through a terrible, beautiful, confusing landscape, with a deeply flawed navigational tool.</strong>

                        Studying the humanities helps us correct our naturally lazy and approximate habits of projection, by putting ourselves into connection with facts. We become, in essence, more precise and alert receptors of the story the world is telling us. We train ourselves in starting out with an initial projection from within some broad reductive category (Englishman; undocumented worker; oppressor; America; hero) and then moving, through thought and study and writing, toward a more complex, particularized version of that entity. This has the effect of infusing our relation to that entity with increased openness and possibility.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In other words, when we study the humanities, we ritually remind ourselves that everybody in this world is on a continuum with us and is therefore somewhat knowable to us. There is no such thing as “the Other,” really; “the Other” is just us on a different day, or having arisen from a different set of circumstances, or beset by a different set of hardships. This impulse may not come naturally to us, but we can, through work and study, train ourselves to get better at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Understood this way, the study of the humanities is not a “weak” version of the sciences, or a nice field for an artsy kid to pursue until she figures out what she’s really about, but the essential thing that human beings do: We study the world in order to understand it more fully and locate ourselves more sanely within it; to make ourselves more powerful, confident and compassionate people.
